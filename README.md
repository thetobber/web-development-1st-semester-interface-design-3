## Group Assignment 3: Full High-Fidelity & Interactive Prototype Implementation
#### Deadline: Friday, 5th May 2017, 23:59

Your third project is based on all the previous assignments you have completed so far, meaning that now itâ€™s time to _put all the pieces together_ and build a **complete prototype of your flight booking system.**
The prototype is to be developed in HTML, CSS (Sass), Javascript & other languages or libraries you believe are needed.

**When testing your prototype I should be able to:**
- Create an account (registration functionality)
- Login with the same credentials I registered with (login functionality)
- View my account and log out from the system
- Search for a flight (choose dates, number of passengers, one-way/return etc.)
- Get results from the search and be able to choose a flight from the results (make sure to specify the search options in a document)
- Add my passenger details after choosing a flight, pay the booking, and finally get the confirmation for the reservation of my tickets

**Features of the prototype**
- It should be complete in terms of visual elements (colors, typography, layout, icons, images etc.)
- The content has to be structured and organized in a legible and user-friendly manner 
- The navigation should be straightforward and ensure usability (e.g. the user should be able to go back to previous pages they visited, know where they are in the flow etc.)
- It should deliver a good user-experience, meaning that you should incorporate features that help the user navigate and interact with your system (pay attention when designing the affordances, signifiers and feedback techniques)

**NOTE:** This prototype should include your proposed solutions from the previous assignments, working as intended. Make sure you focus on the details of your proposed solution, since the rest of the functionality is more or less already implemented.
